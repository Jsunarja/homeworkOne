                I do try to upload new items at least once a week. I also like to do updates including multiple new items.

            <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
            <p>
                Question: Do your scrunchies stretch well for thick hair? 
                <br>
                <br>
                Answer: Every scrunchie I make contains 9 inches of elastic to ensure that both people with thick, thin, long, or short hair have enough elastic and can wrap it as much as they'd like. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Question: Are all your jewelry pieces nickel free?
                <br>
                <br>
                Answer: Every piece listed will say if it is nickel free or not, I do lots of research to make sure if a product I bought is nickel free. If I can't find out this info I will not state that it is nickel free. If you are interested in a piece that doesn't say nickel free, contact me and I can make it specific to your needs.
                <br>
                <br>
                Question: What if I don't have pierced ears?
                <br>
                <br>
                Answer: I do offer clip on earrings that are made to order. That being said, I do ask for 3-5 days after placing your order. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Question: How long does it take to get my order and How do I know where it is at?
                <br>
                <br>
                Answer: I use USPS Shipping which can take anywhere from 2 days to 7 days. Every order will receive a confirmation email and a tracking number when it has been shipped. </p>
